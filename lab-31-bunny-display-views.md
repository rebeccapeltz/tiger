# Build Cute Bunny Display Views with Angular Routing
For this assignment, build three different views and use angular routing to navigate to these views: 
 1. The first view should display the title of the image, the link (not the  actual image), and short description.  
 1. The second view should display the image as a "thumbnail" (within a 100x100 pixel scale). 
 1. The third view should display the title, the full-size image, and the description. 

You can use one or more images.  You should link to them and not try to load them from you project.
You can use your own URL, or work with this cute bunny: http://f.cl.ly/items/3g3J1G0w122M360w380O/3726490195_f7cc75d377_o.jpg 

Create a sample page that loads all three different views for a single hard-coded url, to demonstrate the distinctions between each display mode.
